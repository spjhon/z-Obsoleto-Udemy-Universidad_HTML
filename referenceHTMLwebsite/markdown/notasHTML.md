- Page titles and SEO: The contents of a page title can have significant implications for search engine optimization (SEO). In general, a longer, descriptive title performs better than short or generic titles. The content of the title is one of the components used by search engine algorithms to decide the order in which to list pages in search results. Also, the title is the initial "hook" by which you grab the attention of readers glancing at the search results page. If a form submission contains errors and the submission re-renders the current page, the title can be used to help make users aware of any errors with their submission. For instance, update the page <title> value to reflect significant page state changes (such as form validation problems).

- Only use one <h1> per page - this should represent the main heading/subject for the whole page. Also, do not skip heading levels start with <h1>, then use <h2>, and so on.

- Browsers automatically add a single blank line before and after each <p> element.
